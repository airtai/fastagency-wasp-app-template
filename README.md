You've decided to build a SaaS app with the Open SaaS template. Great choice! 

This template is:

1. fully open-source
2. completely free to use and distribute
3. comes with a ton of features out of the box!
4. focused on free, open-source services, where possible

🧑‍💻 Check it out in action here: [OpenSaaS.sh](https://opensaas.sh)  
📚 Check out the Docs here: [Open SaaS Docs](https://docs.opensaas.sh)

## What's inside?

The template itself is built on top of some very powerful tools and frameworks, including:

- 🐝 [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev) - a full-stack React, NodeJS, Prisma framework with superpowers
- 🚀 [Astro](https://starlight.astro.build/) - Astro's lightweight "Starlight" template for documentation and blog
- 💸 [Stripe](https://stripe.com) - for products and payments
- 📈 [Plausible](https://plausible.io) or [Google](https://analytics.google.com/) Analytics
- 🤖 [OpenAI](https://openai.com) - OpenAI API integrated into the app or [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) (coming soon 👀)
- 📦 [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - for file uploads
- 📧 [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com), [MailGun](https://mailgun.com), or SMTP - for email sending
- 💅 [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - for styling
- 🧑‍💼 [TailAdmin](https://tailadmin.com/) - admin dashboard & components for TailwindCSS
- 🧪 [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) - end-to-end tests with Playwright

Because we're using Wasp as the full-stack framework, we can leverage a lot of its features to build our SaaS in record time, including:

- 🔐 [Full-stack Authentication](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/auth/overview) - Email verified + social Auth in a few lines of code.
- ⛑ [End-to-end Type Safety](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/data-model/operations/overview) - Type your backend functions and get inferred types on the front-end automatically, without the need to install or configure any third-party libraries. Oh, and type-safe Links, too!
- 🤖 [Jobs](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/advanced/jobs) - Run cron jobs in the background or set up queues simply by defining a function in the config file.
- 🚀 [One-command Deploy](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/advanced/deployment/overview) - Easily deploy via the CLI to [Fly.io](https://fly.io), or to other providers like [Railway](https://railway.app) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

You also get access to Wasp's diverse, helpful community if you get stuck or need help.

## Getting Started

### Simple Instructions

First, to install the latest version of [Wasp](https://wasp.sh/) on macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL, run the following command:
```bash
curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh
```

Then, create a new SaaS app with the following command:

```bash
wasp new -t saas
```

This will clone a **clean copy of the Open SaaS template** into a new directory, and you can start building your SaaS app right away!

### Detailed Instructions

For everything you need to know about getting started and using this template, check out the [Open SaaS Docs](https://docs.opensaas.sh).

We've documented everything in great detail, including installation instructions, pulling updates to the template, guides for integrating services, SEO, deployment, and more. 🚀
